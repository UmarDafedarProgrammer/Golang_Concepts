/*
* Data Type specifies the type of data variable can hold
* It also specifies, the size of memory which needs to be allocated for the variable

A> Data Types are divided into 4 categories
---------------------------------------------
1. Basic Type
2. Aggregate Type
3. Reference Type
4. Interface Type

	a> Basic data types are further categorised into 3 types
	--------------------------------------------------------
	1. Numbers
	2. Booleans
	3. Strings

		Numbers
		--------
		Numbers are again categorised into 3 sub categories
 		1. integers
 		2. floats-point numbers
 		3. complex numbers

			1.Integers
			----------
			int - 4/8 bytes, depends up on the processor
			uint/uintptr - unsigned int
			int8 - 8-bit signed integer
			int16 - 16 bit signed integer
			int32/rune - 32 bit signed integer
			int64 - 64 bit signed integer
			uint8/byte - 8 bit unsigned integer
			unit16 - 16 bit unsigned integer
			unit32 - 32 bit unsigned integer
			unit64 - 64 bit unsigned integer
			uintptr - For representing pointer variable
